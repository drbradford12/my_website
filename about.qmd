# About Denise Bradford

Having worked in statistical modeling, data visualization, and big data analytics, I'm a Ph.D. candidate in Statistics at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. From Data Scientist for the Detroit Pistons and the Philadelphia 76ers, where I developed complex data pipelines, analytical dashboards, and predictive models to support strategic decision-making. Previously, I contributed creative ideas for adolescent health and population research while working as a Health Statistician at the CDC.

My scholarly work emphasizes interactive dashboards, open-source data access, analytical tools catered for sports analytics and community decision-making.  Under a National Science Foundation project on "Smart Decision-Making in Small and Shrinking Rural Areas," I have particularly focused on clean, open-source data creation using web scraping and geospatial analysis.  Studies addressing geographic analytics, predictive modeling, and interactive dashboard design have also been published in peer-reviewed publications.

Beyond research, I love to teach and have led seminars on programming in R, statistical modeling, and tidy data techniques.  By always striving to make statistical methods accessible, useful, and actionable, I hope to close the gap between scholarly theory and actual applications.
