::: {#about-block}

## Welcome 

My name is Denise Bradford, a doctoral candidate in Statistics at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, specializing in data science, statistical modeling, and analytics within sports and public health sectors. My professional experience includes roles as a Senior Data Scientist with the Detroit Pistons and Data Scientist with the Philadelphia 76ers, where I've developed sophisticated data pipelines, analytical dashboards, and predictive models to enhance team strategies. Previously, I've served as a Health Statistician at the CDC, contributing innovative methodologies for adolescent health research. I actively publish in statistical journals, contribute to academic conferences, and supports analytics communities through my leadership roles in the American Statistical Association.

## More About Me

My academic work emphasizes interactive dashboards, open-source data access, analytical tools for sports analytics and community decision-making.  Under a National Science Foundation project on "Smart Decision-Making in Small and Shrinking Rural Areas," I have particularly focused on clean, open-source data creation using web scraping and geospatial analysis.  Studies addressing geographic analytics, predictive modeling, and interactive dashboard design have also been published in peer-reviewed publications.

Beyond research, I love to teach and have led seminars on programming in R, statistical modeling, and tidy data techniques. By always striving to make statistical methods accessible, useful, and actionable, I hope to close the gap between scholarly theory and actual applications.

When I'm not busy with work or school, I love watching sports, especially basketball and football. Iâ€™m the Communications Chair for the Statistics in Sports Section of the American Statistical Association (ASA) and along with the Finance Chair for Revitalize Our Communities (ROC). You can usually catch me creating cool structures with magnet tiles with my nieces and nephews.
